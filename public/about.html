<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
I'm Nihal — a web developer with a passion for crafting clean, modern, and user-friendly websites. I specialize in building responsive, high-performance web experiences that not only look great but work seamlessly across all devices.

From front-end design to back-end development, I bring ideas to life with thoughtful code and a focus on usability, speed, and scalability. Every project I take on is built with care, precision, and a clear purpose.

I’m currently available for freelance work — whether you're a business looking to enhance your online presence, a startup building from scratch, or an individual with a unique idea, I’d love to help bring your vision to the web.

Let’s build something great together.</p>
